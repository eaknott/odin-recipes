        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This classic English dish is one of my favorites. Traditionally made with ground lamb or ground beef, this recipe puts a spin on a cottage pie that can be enjoyed by vegetarians and meat lovers alike! It's great for any time of the year, but especially welcome in the cooler seasons.</p>

        <p>Something new that I got to try with this recipe is adding the Greek yogurt to the mashed potatoes. I have to say I was skeptical at first, since I normally enjoy the mashed potatoes with butter, but the Greek yogurt certainly changed my mind! A couple of heaping dollops added to your mashed potatoes gives it a tangy flavor that really complements the richness of the red wine gravy.</p>

        <p>This fantastic recipe is so easy, anyone could make it. A personal tip that I like to do for this dish is chop the veggies fairly small (smaller than bite-size, about one centimeter wide). This may take a bit more prep work and chopping, but the smaller pieces not only cook faster but also give a texture that is much like the ground meat that is traditionally used! Of course, this is entirely up to you.</p>

        <p>Let's get cooking!</p>
