                <div class="p-container">
                    <p>This classic English dish is one of my favorites. Traditionally made with ground lamb or ground beef, this recipe puts a spin on a cottage pie that can be enjoyed by vegetarians and meat lovers alike! It's great for any time of the year, but especially welcome in the cooler seasons.</p>

                    <p>Something new that I got to try with this recipe is adding the Greek yogurt to the mashed potatoes. I have to say I was skeptical at first, since I normally enjoy the mashed potatoes with butter, but the Greek yogurt certainly changed my mind! A couple of heaping dollops added to your mashed potatoes gives it a tangy flavor that really complements the richness of the red wine gravy.</p>

                    <p>This fantastic recipe is so easy, anyone could make it. A personal tip that I like to do for this dish is chop the veggies fairly small (smaller than bite-size, about one centimeter wide). This may take a bit more prep work and chopping, but the smaller pieces not only cook faster but also give a texture that is much like the ground meat that is traditionally used! Of course, this is entirely up to you.</p>

            <li>3 tbsp of olive oil or avocado oil</li>
            <li>3 shallots, minced <em>(or substitute with onion, minced)</em></li>
            <li>16 ounces of white mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>16-20 ounces of green beans, chopped</li>
            <li>6 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>fresh or dried herbs <em>to taste (I like to use Rosemary, Thyme, and a Bay leaf)</em></li>
            <li>2 tbsp of tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of red wine</li>
            <li>1-2 cups of veggie broth</li>
            <li>salt and pepper <em>to taste</em></li>
            <li><em><strong>Optional:</strong> Worcestershire sauce to taste (note: this sauce contains anchovies)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>Mashed Potatoes:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6-8 Yukon Gold potatoes <em>(about 2 pounds)</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Greek Yogurt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of butter or olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper <em>to taste</em></e.></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F</li>
            <li><em>Make the mashed potatoes:</em> peel and roughly chop <strong>potatoes</strong> into big chunks, and boil until fork tender.</li>
            <li>Drain, mash, and mix in a large bowl with <strong>yogurt</strong> and <strong>oil or butter</strong>. Season to taste.</li>
            <li><em>Make the veggies:</em> in a large heavy-based frying pan, heat <strong>oil</strong> over medium heat. Add <strong>shallots</strong> and sauté until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add <strong>carrots</strong> and <strong>green beans</strong> and cook until carrots begin to soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add <strong>mushrooms</strong> and <strong>herbs</strong> <em>(if using fresh herbs and/or a Bay leaf, you will pull these out later).</em> Sauté for another 6-8 minutes.</li>
            <li><em>Make the gravy:</em> Add <strong>tomato paste</strong> and <strong>flour</strong> to the pot and stir, mixing well.</li>
            <li>Pour <strong>red wine</strong> and scrape all the browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Let cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slowly add <strong>broth</strong>, stirring it in until a gravy starts to form.</li>
            <li>Season with <strong>salt and pepper</strong>. <em>Optional: add Worcestershire sauce.</em></li>
            <li>Remove <strong>Bay leaf</strong> and any <strong>fresh herbs</strong>.</li>
            <li>Simmer over low heat to get it to thicken even further, about 5-8 minutes.</li>
            <li><em>Bake:</em> Remove from stove and pour <strong>veggies and gravy</strong> into an oven-safe baking dish. Spread <strong>mashed potatoes</strong> on top.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 15-20 minutes. <em>Optional: for the last 5 minutes, turn on the broil setting to get it nice and brown on the top.</em></li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
