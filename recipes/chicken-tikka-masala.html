        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spice up your life! If you're like me, you're a big fan of delicious Indian food and you have a well-stocked spice cabinet. I've had the pleasure of cooking a few of my favorite Indian dishes, and I've found that this one by far is the tastiest <strong>and</strong> easiest to make. Best of both worlds! It can be enjoyed with Basmati rice, or any rice of your choice, or even with some simply sauteed vegetables.</p>

        <p>The best part of this beautiful dish is the aromatic and healthy spices (did I mention the spices?). Some additional prep time is needed to chop and marinate the chicken. In general, I like to marinate the chicken in the fridge for 30-60 minutes. However, you can marinate it for as little time as 10 minutes, or for as long as 8-10 hours (overnight). The longer the better, but if you're pressed on time, don't worry. This meal will still be full of flavor!</p>

        <p>Let's get started!</p>
