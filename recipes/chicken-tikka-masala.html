        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spice up your life! If you're like me, you're a big fan of delicious Indian food and you have a well-stocked spice cabinet. I've had the pleasure of cooking a few of my favorite Indian dishes, and I've found that this one by far is the tastiest <strong>and</strong> easiest to make. Best of both worlds! It can be enjoyed with Basmati rice, or any rice of your choice, or even with some simply sauteed vegetables.</p>

        <p>The best part of this beautiful dish is the aromatic and healthy spices (did I mention the spices?). Some additional prep time is needed to chop and marinate the chicken. In general, I like to marinate the chicken in the fridge for 30-60 minutes. However, you can marinate it for as little time as 10 minutes, or for as long as 8-10 hours (overnight). The longer the better, but if you're pressed on time, don't worry. This meal will still be full of flavor!</p>

        <p>Let's get started!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4><strong>For the chicken marinade:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>28 ounces (800 g) of boneless and skinless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>

            <li>2 tsp of garam masala</li>
            <li>1 tsp of turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp of cumin powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of red chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>For the sauce:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of butter</li>
            <li>1/2 a yellow onion or 1 small white onion, diced</li>

            <li>1 tbsp of ginger, minced <em>(or 1 tsp of ginger powder)</em></li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp of garam masala</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp of cumin powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp of turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp of ground coriander</li>
            <li>14 ounces (400 g) of tomato puree</li>
            <li>1 tsp of red chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp of salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tsp of brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of water if needed</li>
            <li><em>Optional:</em> 4 tbsp of fresh cilantro to garnish</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine <strong>chicken</strong> with all of the ingredients for the <strong>chicken marinade</strong>. Let marinate for 10 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add <strong>chicken pieces</strong> in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. <em>(You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce).</em></li>
            <li>Melt the <strong>butter</strong> in the same pan. Fry the <strong>onion</strong> until soft (about 3 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Add <strong>garlic and ginger</strong> and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add <strong> garam masala, cumin, turmeric,</strong> and <strong>coriander</strong>. Fry for about 20-30 seconds until fragrant, stirring continuously.</li>
            <li>Pour in <strong>tomato puree, chili powder,</strong> and <strong>salt</strong>. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red color.</li>
            <li>Stir the <strong>cream and brown sugar</strong> through the sauce. Add the <strong>chicken</strong> and its juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in the <strong>water</strong> to thin out the sauce, if needed.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh, chopped cilantro and serve with rice, sauteed veggies, or fresh Naan bread.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
