                <div class="p-container">
                    <p>This tasty dish is perfect for those cold evenings in the fall or winter seasons. Although the simmering stage adds an hour to the cook time, a hot bowl of this casserole is well worth the wait. Together with some in-season vegetables, a bit of tomato paste, white wine, and stock, this chicken dish will warm your body and soul.</p>
                    <p>I first came across this recipe at the start of autumn last year, when a drop in temperature produced a particularly chilly day compared to the three months of hot summer we had. What I love most about cooking this dish is that the magic happens all in one pot! It's so simple to prepare, and I just need to keep in mind the extra hour of simmering at the end. This meal is so warming and delicious that even my hungry and impatient husband is willing to wait the extra hour for a couple of hearty helpings!</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat <strong>oil</strong> in a large heavy-based frying pan over medium heat. Add the <strong>chicken</strong> and cook on both sides, for about 5-6 minutes or until browned. Transfer to a plate. <em>Note: be sure not to cook the chicken all the way through, as it will be added back to the pan later to simmer.</em></li>
            <li>Add more oil or butter as needed, and add in the <strong>onion, garlic, carrot, celery,</strong> and <strong>potato</strong>. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring for 8-10 minutes or until vegetables are softened.</li>
            <li>Add <strong>white wine</strong> and cook, stirring until the liquid has evaporated a bit, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the <strong>flour</strong> and stir to mix well, cooking additionally for about 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Separately, combine <strong>stock, tomato paste</strong> and <strong>water</strong> in a saucepan and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Return <strong>cooked chicken</strong> to the pan and add in <strong>stock mixture</strong>.</li>
            <li>Season with <strong>salt, pepper, oregano,</strong> and <strong>basil</strong>.</li>
            <li>Stir to combine and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has turned into a gravy.</li>
            <li><em>Optional:</em> top with <strong>fresh basil leaves</strong> and serve with <strong>crusty bread</strong>.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
